Unless having state, the server is always expecting for a 32bit uint as a command

Defined basic command:
5: client sends ping
  6: server returns pong

7 <matrix size>: client sends the size of the matrix, then sends the two matrices (one elemenet at a time)
  8 <matrix id>: sever sends the recently added matrix id to the client

9 <matrix id>: client asks server to add the two matrices

10 <matrix id>: client asks server for the result of the matrix addition
  11: server response no result yer
  12 <matrix size>: server returns the sum12
