Unless having state, the server is always expecting for a 32bit uint as a command

Defined basic command:
> 5: ping
> 6: pong (sent from the server)

7 <matrix size>: client sends the size of the matrix, then sends the two matrices (one elemenet at a time)
8 <matrix id>: sever sends the recently added matrix id to the client
9 <matrix id>: client asks server to add the two matrices
10 <matrix id>: server sends the result of the addition to the client
